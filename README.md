## NinjaScript Misc Utilities

This repository contains a small selection of utilities / classes I've worked on over the many years working on NinjaScript consulting projects. 

- Descriptions of each file are in the 'NinjaScript Utils' readme.

*NOTE: These classes were originally created for my own use. Most of the code is decently commented, however there are many common team-friendly conventions that are not in practice. If you improve upon any of these classes please feel free to send a pull request!*
